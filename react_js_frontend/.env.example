# React Frontend Environment Variables

# Base URL of the FastAPI backend. If not set, the app will use window.location.origin.
# Example for local development:
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000

# NOTE:
# - Leave this empty if you proxy or deploy frontend and backend on the same origin.
# - Set it to the backend origin if they run on different ports or hosts.
